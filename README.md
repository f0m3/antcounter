# antcounter
count ants running through a translucent tube between the nest and a feeding arena using an arduino (maybe an esp32 later) and two cny70 side-by-side taped to the tube.
The order of cny70 movement detection determines if the ant is running in or out. I tested it with lasius niger and a ~5mm diameter tube.
